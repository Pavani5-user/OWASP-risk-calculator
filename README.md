# OWASP-risk-calculator
This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and helps identify critical situations by quantifying risk through numerical scores and visualizing it through a bar graph. This enables organizations to prioritize remediation efforts and make informed decisions. The calculator highlights potential vulnerabilities by evaluating various threat agents, vulnerabilities, technical impact, and business impact factors. By using this tool, organizations can proactively address security risks, reducing the likelihood of critical situations.
